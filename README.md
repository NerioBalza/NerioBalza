# üëã Hi, I'm Nerio Balza

I‚Äôm a FullStack Developer with experience in JavaScript, React, Node, Express, Html5, Css3, Git, Sass, with high capacity for teamwork, creativity and learning. My main experience is in the Frontend Development area, making responsive websites and web applications that are accessible for users, true to the design and always working with the best practices and the latest technologies. In addition, I also have experience making Backend services such as REST APIS and Data Bases. Among my interests are the development process, the whole lifecycle of a product, learning and gaining knowledge from failures and successes.

My mission is to create software that has a positive impact on society. I'm very focused on delivering the best user experience possible to the products, solving  and understanding the real world problems of the users and translating them into a solution within a product.
